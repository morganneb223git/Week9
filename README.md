# Real Time Bus Tracker

## I incorporated the mapboxgl library to animate markers along MBTA bus routes between Harvard and MIT. By obtaining a Mapbox access token, I initiated marker animation, showcasing movement between bus stops.

## How To Use
- Download the Files: Obtain the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files provided.
- Set Up Mapbox Account: Create a Mapbox account and obtain an access token.
- Update HTML File: Replace the placeholder access token with your Mapbox access token.
- Run the Code: Open the HTML file in a web browser.
- Click the Button: Click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to initiate marker animation.
- Observe Animation: Watch as the marker moves along the bus stops between MIT and Harvard on the map.

## Future Improvements
- Add a button to toggle between bus routes.
- Add a button to pause and resume marker animation.
- Add a button to reset the marker to the starting position.
- Add a button to change the animation speed.
- Add a button to change the animation
